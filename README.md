* Objective *
Our objective perform basic EDA to uncover the trends, correlations, and patterns.
Generate visualizations for temperature and precipitation.

Through temparature map, according to latitude and longitude and location map we can find the distribution among the countries has been shown.
Through the bar chart the average tenparature of each countries has been shown.
Through the scatter plot the temparature vs humidity is shown.
Through a 3D scatter plot the correlation between wind, humidity and temperature has been shown.
Through a calender heatmap the distribution of temparature in different cities or locations has been shown.
Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed Trends for Top 10 Cities has been shown here.
